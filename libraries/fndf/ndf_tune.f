      SUBROUTINE NDF_TUNE( VALUE, TPAR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDF_TUNE

*  Purpose:
*     Set an NDF_ system tuning parameter.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDF_TUNE( VALUE, TPAR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine sets a new value for an NDF_ system internal tuning
*     parameter.

*  Arguments:
*     VALUE = INTEGER (Given)
*        New value for the tuning parameter.
*     TPAR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Name of the parameter to be set (case insensitive).  This name
*        may be abbreviated, to no less than 3 characters.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     The following tuning parameters are currently available:
*     - 'AUTO_HISTORY': Controls whether to include an empty History
*     component in NDFs created using NDF_NEW or NDF_CREAT. If the
*     tuning parameter is zet to zero (the default), no History
*     component will be included in the new NDFs. If the tuning
*     parameter is zet non-zero, a History component will be added
*     automatically to the new NDFs.
*     - 'DOCVT': Controls whether to convert foreign format data files
*     to and from native NDF format for access (using the facilities
*     described in SSN/20). If DOCVT is set to 1 (the default), and the
*     other necessary steps described in SSN/20 have been taken, then
*     such conversions will be performed whenever they are necessary to
*     gain access to data stored in a foreign format. If DOCVT is set
*     to 0, no such conversions will be attempted and all data will be
*     accessed in native NDF format only. The value of DOCVT may be
*     changed at any time. It is the value current when a dataset is
*     first accessed by the NDF_ library which is significant.
*     -  'KEEP': Controls whether to retain a native format NDF copy of
*     any foreign format data files which are accessed by the NDF_
*     library (and automatically converted using the facilities
*     described in SSN/20). If KEEP is set to 0 (the default), then
*     the results of converting foreign format data files will be stored
*     in scratch filespace and deleted when no longer required. If KEEP
*     is set to 1, the results of the conversion will instead be stored
*     in permanent NDF data files in the default directory (such files
*     will have the same name as the foreign file from which they are
*     derived and a file type of '.sdf'). Setting KEEP to 1 may be
*     useful if the same datasets are to be re-used, as it avoids having
*     to convert them on each occasion. The value of KEEP may be changed
*     at any time. It is the value current when a foreign format file is
*     first accessed by the NDF_ library which is significant.
*     -  'SECMAX': Gives the largest size of an NDF section, in units of
*     maga-pixels. An error is reported if a section is requested that
*     contains more than this number of pixels. The purpose of this
*     parameter is to help guard against accidental use of incorrect units
*     within NDF sections specified by the user. The default value is 1E10.
*     -  'SHCVT': Controls whether diagnostic information is displayed
*     to show the actions being taken to convert to and from foreign
*     data formats (using the facilities described in SSN/20). If SHCVT
*     is set to 1, then this information is displayed to assist in
*     debugging external format conversion software whenever a foreign
*     format file is accessed. If SHCVT is set to 0 (the default), this
*     information does not appear and format conversion proceeds
*     silently unless an error occurs.
*     -  'TRACE': Controls the reporting of additional error messages
*     which may occasionally be useful for diagnosing internal problems
*     within the NDF_ library. If TRACE is set to 1, then any error
*     occurring within the NDF_ system will be accompanied by error
*     messages indicating which internal routines have exited
*     prematurely as a result. If TRACE is set to 0 (the default),
*     this internal diagnostic information will not appear and only
*     standard error messages will be produced.
*     -  'WARN': Controls the issuing of warning messages when certain
*     non-fatal errors in the structure of NDF data objects are
*     detected. If WARN is set to 1 (the default), then a warning
*     message is issued. If WARN is set to 0, then no message is
*     issued.  In both cases normal execution continues and no STATUS
*     value is set.
*     -  'PXT...': Controls whether a named NDF extension should be
*     propagated by default when NDF_PROP or NDF_SCOPY is called. The
*     name of the extension should be appended to the string "PXT" to
*     form the complete tuning parameter name. Thus the tuning parameter
*     PXTFITS would control whether the FITS extension is propagated by
*     default. If the value for the parameter is non-zero, then the
*     extension will be propagated by default. If the value for the
*     parameter is zero, then the extension will not be propagated by
*     default. The default established by this tuning parameter can be
*     over-ridden by specifying the extension explicitly within the CLIST
*     argument when calling NDF_PROP or NDF_SCOPY. The default value for
*     all "PXT..." tuning parameters is 1, meaning that all extensions
*     are propagated by default.
*     - 'FIXDT': If FIXDT is set to 1, the date and time string stored
*     in any new History records will be fixed at an arbitrary value
*     ("10-AUG-2018 11:00:00") regardless of the current time. If 0, the
*     real date and time will be used. This facility is intended to allow
*     regression testing, where any change in the date/time within history
*     records could cause a test to fail.
*     - 'FIXSW': If FIXSW is set to 1, the path section of the software
*     field stored in any new History records will be fixed at a blank
*     string regardless of the current time. If 0, the real path will be
*     retained. This facility is intended to allow regression testing,
*     where any change in the software path within history records could
*     cause a test to fail.
