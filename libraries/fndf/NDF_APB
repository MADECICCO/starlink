*  Name:
*     NDF_APB

*  Purpose:
*     Define the NDF_ system ADAM Parameter Block (APB).

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global variables include file.

*  Description:
*     This file defines global variables which are used to record
*     usage of ADAM parameters by the NDF library.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The NDF_CONST and EMS__PAR include files should be included
*     before this file, in order to define constants used here.

*  Global Variables:

*  An AST KeyMap in which each entry has a key that is an ADAM parameter
*  name, and a value that is a boolean flag indicating if NDF_CANCL should
*  cancel the parameter if supplied with a blank parameter name. The
*  parameters stored in the KeyMap are the ones for which the NDF library
*  has stored explicit locators in the parameter system using
*  SUBPAR_PUTFLOC and SUBPAR_PUTLOC. These locators are only release
*  when the parameter is cancelled, or the parameter system is shut down.
*  In order to avoid apparent HDS locator leaks, applications may use
*  NDF_CANCL to cancel all actice NDF parameters.
