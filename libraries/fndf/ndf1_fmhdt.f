      SUBROUTINE NDF1_FMHDT( YMDHM, SEC, STR, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDF1_FMHDT

*  Purpose:
*     Format a date and time as a string in standard history format.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDF1_FMHDT( YMDHM, SEC, STR, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine formats a date and time into the standard format for
*     recording date/time information in NDF history records, for
*     example: '1993-MAY-25 02:32:53.152'.

*  Arguments:
*     YMDHM( 5 ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        The year, month, day, hour and minute fields of the date and
*        time (in that order), stored as integers.
*     SEC = REAL (Given)
*        The seconds field.
*     STR = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        The formatted date/time string. A character variable with a
*        length of at least NDF__SZHDT characters should be provided to
*        hold this result.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
