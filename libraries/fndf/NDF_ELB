*  Name:
*     NDF_ELB

*  Purpose:
*     Define the NDF_ system Error Logging Block (ELB).

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global variables include file.

*  Description:
*     This file defines global variables which are used to log error
*     messages for subsequent recording in NDF history records.

*  Notes:
*     In use, a snapshot of the current EMS error stack is recorded in
*     this block by the routine NDF1_HLERR and subsequently appended to
*     an NDF's current history record by the routine NDF1_HDERR.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The NDF_CONST and EMS__PAR include files should be included
*     before this file, in order to define constants used here.
