*  Name:
*     NDF_PCB

*  Purpose:
*     Define NDF_ system Placeholder Control Block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global variables include file.

*  Description:
*     This file defines global variables which hold information about
*     placeholders used by the NDF_ system. Entries in this block are
*     kept in one-to-one correspondence with placeholder identifiers
*     issued to users.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The SAE_PAR, NDF_PAR and NDF_CONST include files should be
*     included prior to this file, in order to define constants used
*     here.

*  Global Variables:

*  Which slots have been used.
*  ==========================
*  This array is initialised to .FALSE. by the NDF1_INIT block data
*  routine. Its entries are then selectively set to .TRUE. to indicate
*  which slots in the PCB are in use (i.e. have identifiers issued for
*  them).
      LOGICAL PCB_USED( NDF__MXPCB )
      
*  Placeholder locator.
*  ===================
*  If a slot is in use, then the PCB_LOC entry holds an HDS locator to
*  an NDF_ placeholder object, which reserves a position in the data
*  system.
      CHARACTER * ( DAT__SZLOC ) PCB_LOC( NDF__MXPCB )

*  Temporary placeholder flag.
*  ==========================
*  If a slot is in use, then the PCB_TMP entry indicates whether the
*  object which will replace the placeholder is to be temporary.
      LOGICAL PCB_TMP( NDF__MXPCB )

*  New placeholder object flag.
*  ===========================
*  If a slot is in use, then the PCB_NEW entry contains a logical value
*  indicating whether a new placeholder object was created by the NDF_
*  system (as opposed to a pre-existing object being passed by the
*  caller). This flag is used to decide whether to delete the
*  placeholder object when cleaning up after any error.
      LOGICAL PCB_NEW( NDF__MXPCB )
      
*  Foreign format code, propagation flag, file name, ID, etc.
*  =========================================================
*  If a slot is in use, and a foreign file may be associated with the
*  new NDF described by a PCB entry, then the PCB_IFMT entry holds an
*  FCB format code identifying the format of the foreign file, PCB_FORFL
*  holds the file's name and PCB_FORID holds a unique identification
*  code for the file (if it already exists). If "wild carding" of the
*  output format is enabled and no foreign format information has yet
*  been propagated to the PCB entry, then PCB_PRFMT will be set .TRUE.,
*  indicating that uncertainty still exists about the actual format of
*  any foreign file. In this case, the PCB_IFMT value will be the
*  default, which may be over-ridden by subsequent propagation of this
*  information, and the PCB_FORFL value will hold the full name of the
*  NDF as originally supplied (it may later require re-interpretation
*  in the light of the propagated format information, so PCB_FORID will
*  be blank).
      INTEGER PCB_IFMT( NDF__MXPCB )
      LOGICAL PCB_PRFMT( NDF__MXPCB )
      CHARACTER * ( NDF__SZFIL ) PCB_FORFL( NDF__MXPCB )
      CHARACTER * ( NDF__SZFID ) PCB_FORID( NDF__MXPCB )

*  If a slot is in use and there is a foreign format file associated
*  with it (see above), then the PCB_FORKP entry indicates whether the
*  native NDF copy of the foreign data is to be kept (as opposed to
*  being held in a temporary object which is deleted when the NDF is
*  released from the NDF_ system).
      LOGICAL PCB_FORKP( NDF__MXPCB )

*  Record of identifiers issued.
*  ============================
*  The value of PCB_PLCNT is initialised by the NDF1_INIT block data
*  routine and is incremented each time a placeholder identifier is
*  issued.  The next identifier value is generated using the new value
*  of PCB_PLCNT and this ensures that identifier values are not
*  re-used.  When an identifier is issued for a slot, its value is
*  stored in the PCB_CHK entry and an identifier is only considered
*  valid if it matches the PCB_CHK entry in the slot to which it
*  refers. This allows identifiers to be rendered invalid either by the
*  user (by assigning the NDF__NOPL value to them), or by the NDF_
*  system (by marking the slot as not used, or by re-using it with a
*  new identifier value).
      INTEGER PCB_CHK( NDF__MXPCB )
      INTEGER PCB_PLCNT

*  If a slot is in use, then the PCB_CTX entry contains the identifier
*  context level at which the placeholder identifier for the slot was
*  issued. This allows the appropriate placeholders to be annulled when
*  each NDF_ context is closed.
      INTEGER PCB_CTX( NDF__MXPCB )

*  Non-character data.
      COMMON /NDF1_PCB1/ PCB_CHK, PCB_CTX, PCB_FORKP, PCB_IFMT, PCB_NEW,
     :                   PCB_PLCNT, PCB_PRFMT, PCB_TMP, PCB_USED

*  Character data.
      COMMON /NDF1_PCB2/ PCB_FORFL, PCB_FORID, PCB_LOC

*  Save common block contents.
