      SUBROUTINE NDF1_HNEW( LOC1, NAME, TYPE, NDIM, DIM, LOC2, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     NDF1_HNEW

*  Purpose:
*     Create a new HDS object.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Invocation:
*     CALL NDF1_HNEW( LOC1, NAME, TYPE, NDIM, DIM, LOC2, STATUS )

*  Description:
*     The routine creates a new HDS object. It performs a similar task
*     to the HDS routine DAT_NEW, except that it will accept a compound
*     component name consisting of a sequence of component names
*     separated by '.' (array slice/cell subscripts may also be
*     included). A complete object specification including a container
*     file name may also be given if the input locator supplied is
*     set to DAT__ROOT. All components which appear in the NAME
*     argument except for the last one must already exist.  The object
*     to be created must not itself exist.  If successful, the routine
*     returns a locator to the new object. This will be a primary
*     locator if a new container file was opened or created (i.e. if
*     LOC1 was set to DAT__ROOT), otherwise it will be a secondary
*     locator.

*  Arguments:
*     LOC1 = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Locator to an existing HDS structure (or DAT__ROOT if the NAME
*        argument contains a complete object specification).
*     NAME = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        Relative HDS path name of the object to be created.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Given)
*        HDS object type.
*     NDIM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of object dimensions.
*     DIM( NDIM ) = INTEGER (Given)
*        Object dimensions.
*     LOC2 = CHARACTER * ( * ) (Returned)
*        Locator to the new object.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Notes:
*     If this routine is called with STATUS set, then an invalid
*     locator will be returned via the LOC2 argument. The same value
*     will also be returned if the routine should fail for any reason.

*  History:
*     10-DEC-1990 (RFWS):
*        Original version.
*     23-JUN-1993 (RFWS):
*        Upgraded to accept DAT__ROOT as an input locator value and to
*        interpret NAME as a complete object specification, returning a
*        primary locator in this case.
*     8-OCT-1993 (RFWS):
*        Removed unnecessary status checks.
*     12-OCT-1993 (RFWS):
*        Added extra arguments to NDF1_FSPLT call.
*     27-DEC-2005 (TIMJ):
*        Call HDS_SPLIT rather than NDF1_HSPLT.
*        Call HDS_FIND rather than NDF1_HFIND
