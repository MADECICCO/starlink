*  Name:
*     NDF_FCB

*  Purpose:
*     Define the NDF_ system Format Conversion Block.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     Global variables include file.

*  Description:
*     This file contains definitions of global variables used
*     internally by the NDF_ system to hold information about the
*     foreign file formats to be recognised.

*  Prior Requirements:
*     The NDF_CONST include file should be included prior to this file,
*     in order to define constants which are needed here.

*  Global Variables:
*  ================

*  List specifying foreign data formats which are to be recognised.
*  Note that input formats occupy the first half of this list and
*  output formats the second half (the same pattern is also followed by
*  the arrays declared below).
      CHARACTER * ( 2 * NDF__SZFMT ) FCB_FMT

*  First and last character positions of foreign format names (in
*  FCB_FMT).
      INTEGER FCB_FMT1( 2 * NDF__MXFMT )
      INTEGER FCB_FMT2( 2 * NDF__MXFMT )

*  First and last character positions of foreign file name extensions
*  (in FCB_FMT).
      INTEGER FCB_FEX1( 2 * NDF__MXFMT )
      INTEGER FCB_FEX2( 2 * NDF__MXFMT )

*  Number of input and output data formats.
      INTEGER FCB_NIN
      INTEGER FCB_NOUT

*  Common blocks:
*  =============

*  Character values.
      COMMON /NDF1_FCB1/ FCB_FMT

*  Other values:
      COMMON /NDF1_FCB2/ FCB_FEX1, FCB_FEX2, FCB_FMT1, FCB_FMT2,
     :                   FCB_NIN, FCB_NOUT

*  Save common block contents.
      SAVE /NDF1_FCB1/
      SAVE /NDF1_FCB2/
